# Understanding Language Dependencies by analyzing Cognates

## Objective
This project was carried out the with following objectives in mind:

1. Correlation of semantic change over time for different languages.
2. Correlation of distance (between regions where language is spoken) with origin of cognates.
3. Examining the Influence of semantic density in a language on meaning shift in cognate.

## Dataset

The datasets used are as follows:

1. [CogNet](https://github.com/kbatsuren/CogNet?search=1)
2. [HistWords](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/histwords/)
3. [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org/glottolog/language)

## Repo Structure

Each ipynb file corresponds to each objective function mentioned above.

1. Objective 1: Inter-Language Dependencies.ipynb
2. Objective 2: Regional Analysis.ipynb
3. Objective 3: Semantic Density.ipynb
